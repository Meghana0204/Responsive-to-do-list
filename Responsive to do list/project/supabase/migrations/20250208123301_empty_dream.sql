/*
  # Create tasks table and security policies

  1. New Tables
    - `tasks`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `user_id` (uuid, references auth.users)
      - `title` (text)
      - `description` (text)
      - `due_date` (timestamptz)
      - `priority` (text)
      - `time_allotted` (text)
      - `category` (text)
      - `completed` (boolean)
      - `created_at` (timestamptz)

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on `tasks` table
    - Add policies for:
      - Users can read their own tasks
      - Users can create their own tasks
      - Users can update their own tasks
      - Users can delete their own tasks
